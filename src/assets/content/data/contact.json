Getting as close as you are means, only see what you do. We spend the time to understand your problem in it’s context but from a perspective where we can diagnose a solution. </p><p class=\"p1\">Beginning with <a href=\"\" title=\"\">Clean scoping</a> we collectively gain an understanding of your readiness to begin the process, also you will get a flavour of how we work, and there will be clarity about the remit of the work we are about undertake.</p><p class=\"p1\">We are so sure of this way of working, we typically work at fixed price, rather than time and materials. As long as you let us prepare your organisation for what we need, we will get the job done, in a timely fashion</p><p class=\"p2\">We call that being Refreshing Frank</p>",
