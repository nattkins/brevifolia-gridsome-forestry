We owe a great deal to Caitlin Walker who invented Clean Scoping; the idea being to ask a few 'clean' questions which focus on the problem that we are hoping to scope and using the answers as evidence she proceeds to draw some testable inferences. This sounds innocuous enough but her contention is that within the framing of the problem there is highly likely to be a contradiction, problems are most always contradictions if you think of your own life, its I want more money but I'm spending too much time at work, or why can't I find time to be more spontaneous) 

The point of the inference is to present this with curiosity to the potential client to see if they see the contradiction - if they do and are able to update their model sufficiently then the scoping has been a success, if not Walker then assumes that this client is either able or willing now to do the work necessary at the moment.
